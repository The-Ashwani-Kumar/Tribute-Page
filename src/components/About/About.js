        <p className='para1'>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family
          in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and
          now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam
          of a local mosque, his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that
          took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
          Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had
          been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts
          of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had
          lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born.
          Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance
          from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the
          mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the
          mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's
          meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
          businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the
          ancestral home.
          <br /><br/>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking
          student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
          After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam
          went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University
          of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study
          aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior
          class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke
          his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
          impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to
          meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot,
          as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

        <h2 className='head1'>Personal Life</h2>
        <p className='para1'>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister,
          Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar
          (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021), Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed
          (d. 1995). He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families
          throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations,
          himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.

          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television,
          and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal
          possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop;
          at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.

        <h2 className='head1'>Presidency</h2>
        <p className='para1'>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.
          He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366
          votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.
          On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed
          that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist
          Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam,
          Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear. Kalam said of the
          announcement of his candidature:
          <br /><br />

          <i className='para1'> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message.
            <br /> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.</i>

          <br /><br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
          The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
          assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was
          a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic
          of India in an easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25
          July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's
          highest civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir
          Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.
          He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.

        <h2 className='head1'>Death</h2>
        <p className='para1'>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
          "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.
          While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to
          enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes
          into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a
          critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.
          Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden
          cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh,
          were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?".
